# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Researched about Github, 100-days-of-code challenge and ready to start.
                      Started front-end at FCC (23 challenges)

**Thoughts:** I'm committed and even thought I have basic knowledge about front-end and back-end development, I'm rusty so I may need to start over.

**Hours Spent:** 2

**Link to work:** [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/map)

### Day 1: June 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I had family stuff to deal with so this is the day I could start properly. 
                      Today I've come to the 89th challenge of the FCC

**Thoughts:** I should try harder not to skip any day without coding. This habit is a bit hard to gain.  

**Hours Spent:** 2,5

### Day 1: July 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've come to basic front-end projects, challenge 118. 

**Thoughts:** Back to day 1. Unfortunately my granpa is very sick so whole week I had to be beside him and my mom. So starting over this challenge, and will try my best these days.  

**Hours Spent:** 2,5

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Researched about Github, 100-days-of-code challenge and ready to start.
                      Started front-end at FCC (23 challenges)

**Thoughts:** I'm committed and even thought I have basic knowledge about front-end and back-end development, I'm rusty so I may need to start over.
